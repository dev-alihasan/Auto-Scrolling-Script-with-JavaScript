# Auto-Scrolling for Web Pages


u can use JavaScript to manipulate the scroll position of a web page, which can give you control over the scrolling behavior
## Usage/Examples

```javascript
window.scrollBy(0, scrollSpeed);
```
0 as the first argument: this argument specifies the number of pixels to scroll horizontally. In this case, it's set to 0, which means no horizontal scrolling is performed. 
the value of 0 indicates no change in the horizontal scroll position.
